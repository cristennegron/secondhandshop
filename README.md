## About
An e-commerce website dedicated to one of a kind, second-hand finds. Each item featured is hand-picked, sourced from local thrift shops, estate sales, and consignment stores. 

Real life application: Many of my friends run second hand stores via instagram or third-party apps such as Depop or Poshmark. I'd love to create beautiful, user-friendly websites in order for them to grow their storefronts.

*New name to come once a shop name has been decided upon.*
